      <h1>Hello World!</h1>
      <h2>This is my first GitHub page. Welcome.</h2>
      <p>I'm currently doing the Codecademy Pro Intensive, Build Websites from Scratch (often referred to on Codecademy as BWS). I have a background in graphic design, but am starting off not knowing anything really about HTML, CSS or Git. I would say this is a good intro to get your feet wet and dive in.</p>

      <h2>BWS: Weeks 1 and 2</h2>
      <p>I'm two weeks into the course and so far I've done:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Unit 1: HTML</li>
        <li>Unit 2: CSS</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <p>And I'm deep into Unit 3: Command Line and Git.</p>
      <h3>Check out some of the projects I've done:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Two Sandals</li>
        <li>Beach Paradise</li>
        <li> <a href="https://sachilaw.github.io/DasmotosArts/" target="_blank">Dasmoto's Arts & Crafts</a></li>
        <li>And of course, this page right here</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <p>They aren't very pretty, I know, but I'm excited to see what my final projects look like!</p>
      <br>
      <h3>Some key concepts and tools I've learned from Uits 1 & 2:</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>What is HTML?</li>
        <li>How HTML works and the basics of how to use it.</li>
        <li>Atom is an awesome free text editor that makes coding a lot easier and faster!</li>
        <li>What is CSS?</li>
        <li>CSS basics (very) and how to use CSS with HTML to put together simple pages.</li>
        <li>What is a code validator and how to use it?</li>
        <li>The importance of practice and trying, and trying again.</li>
        <li>Coding is like problem solving and it's fun!</li>
      </ol>
      <br>
      <p>Well, bye for now and let's see where week 3 of BWS takes me!</p>
